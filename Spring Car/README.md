This folder contains a spring car.
I chose to build this machine beacuse I had a lot of toys like this in my childhood and I wanted to know how this toy works and how it is builded. It's movement is based by a spring that is stretched by moving the back wheels backwards. When the back wheels start to move, they move the gears inside the car making the spring to stretch or release. When we finish moving the back wheels backwards, the spring realeases and it moves the back wheels through the gears, making the car to go forward. 
To see make motion I need to use revolve joints between the axles and chassis and rigid groups between the gears the axles and the wheels(when the axles spin inside the chassis, the gears that are on the axles spin too). To move evrything, I rotate the back wheels wich move the back axle and the gears on it, and they move the other axles wich move the small gear. The small gears move the big gears and than they move the gear that it is attached on the same axle as the spring wich make the spring strecth. To move it forward, I rotate the spring axle wich makes the back wheels to go forward thorugh the gears. to see the movement i used the motion study wich activates the back wheel axle.
To design and render the mechanism i used Fusion 360 and for slicing I used Prusa Slicer.
